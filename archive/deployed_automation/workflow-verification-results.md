# Workflow Verification Results

## Current Status: NEEDS FIXES

### Critical Errors (4):

1. **OpenAI Chat Model** 
   - Error: Missing required 'model' parameter
   - Fix: Edit node and select "gpt-4o-mini" from model dropdown

2. **Extract from File**
   - Error: Missing 'Input Binary Field'
   - Fix: Edit node and set Binary Property Name to "data"

3. **Email - Standard**
   - Error: Nested expressions in subject line
   - Current: `{{$json['Candidate Name']}}`
   - Fix to: `{{ $json['Candidate Name'] }}`

4. **Workflow Cycle Warning**
   - This is FALSE POSITIVE - Split In Batches is designed to loop
   - No fix needed

### What's Working Well ✅:

- ✅ Get All CVs via API (using HTTP Request - good workaround)
- ✅ Filter PDFs Only (using Code node - reliable)
- ✅ AI Agent with proper Data Analyst prompt
- ✅ Parse AI Response handles agent output correctly
- ✅ Google Sheets logging configured
- ✅ Error handling with separate email paths
- ✅ File moving to Processed/Failed folders

### Quick Fixes Needed:

1. Click on **OpenAI Chat Model** node
   - Select Model: "gpt-4o-mini"
   - Save

2. Click on **Extract from File** node
   - Add Binary Property Name: "data"
   - Save

3. Click on **Email - Standard** node
   - Fix subject: `CV Processed: {{ $json['Candidate Name'] }} (Score: {{ $json.Score }})`
   - Save

### Ready to Test After Fixes ✅

Once these 3 simple fixes are made, the workflow should be ready to:
1. Fetch PDFs from Google Drive
2. Extract text content
3. Analyze with AI Agent
4. Log to Google Sheets
5. Send email notifications
6. Move files to appropriate folders

The workflow is well-structured and uses good practices like:
- HTTP Request for reliable Google Drive access
- Code node for filtering
- AI Agent instead of direct API calls
- Proper error handling paths
