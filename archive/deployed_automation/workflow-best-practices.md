# CV Screening Workflow - Best Practices

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Solution

Based on n8n best practices, the optimal approach for your CV screening workflow is:

### 1. **Primary: Scheduled Execution (Every 30 minutes)**
- More reliable and resource-efficient
- Processes all accumulated CVs in batches
- Prevents duplicate processing
- Predictable execution windows

### 2. **Secondary: Keep Folder Monitor for Urgent Cases**
- Allows immediate processing when needed
- Good for high-priority candidates
- Acts as a backup trigger

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Scheduled-Only Approach (Recommended)
```
Benefits:
✅ Processes all new CVs every 30 minutes
✅ No duplicate processing issues
✅ Better resource management
✅ Predictable processing times
✅ Easier to monitor and debug

Setup:
1. Disable/Remove the Google Drive Trigger
2. Add Schedule Trigger node (every 30 minutes)
3. Keep "Get All New CVs" to list all PDFs
4. Process in batches of 5
```

### Option B: Hybrid Approach
```
Benefits:
✅ Immediate processing for urgent CVs
✅ Regular cleanup of accumulated files
✅ Best of both worlds

Setup:
1. Keep Google Drive Trigger (real-time)
2. Add parallel Schedule Trigger (every hour)
3. Both triggers connect to "Get All New CVs"
4. Add deduplication logic to prevent double processing
```

### Option C: Event-Driven with Cooldown
```
Benefits:
✅ Real-time processing
✅ Prevents trigger spam
✅ Processes all accumulated files

Setup:
1. Keep Google Drive Trigger
2. Add a "cooldown" mechanism:
   - Store last execution time
   - Skip if executed < 5 minutes ago
3. Process all files when triggered
```

## Why Scheduled Execution is Better for Your Use Case

1. **Batch Processing Efficiency**
   - Your workflow already uses "Split In Batches" (5 items)
   - Scheduled execution ensures multiple CVs are available
   - Better utilization of OpenAI API calls

2. **Predictable Resource Usage**
   - Know exactly when processing occurs
   - Can schedule during off-peak hours
   - Easier to monitor and maintain

3. **No Duplicate Processing**
   - Each execution processes only unprocessed CVs
   - Files are moved to Processed/Failed folders
   - Clean slate for next execution

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - If one execution fails, next scheduled run catches up
   - Easier to debug issues with predictable timing
   - Can review logs at specific intervals

## Recommended Settings

### For Scheduled Execution:
- **Frequency**: Every 30 minutes during business hours
- **Example**: Mon-Fri, 8 AM - 6 PM, every 30 minutes
- **Weekend**: Once every 2 hours (if needed)

### For Hybrid Approach:
- **Folder Monitor**: Keep for immediate needs
- **Schedule**: Every hour as cleanup
- **Add logic**: Check if files were recently processed

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Current workflow processes sequentially
   - Consider parallel API calls for faster processing

2. **Resource Management**
   - Schedule during low-activity periods
   - Monitor execution times
   - Adjust batch size based on performance

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Failed folder ensures no CV is lost
   - Schedule can reprocess failed items
   - Add retry logic for API failures

## Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Set up execution alerts**
   - Email on workflow failure
   - Slack notification for high-scoring candidates
   - Weekly summary reports

2. **Track metrics**
   - Average processing time per CV
   - Success/failure rates
   - API usage and costs

3. **Regular maintenance**
   - Clean up Processed folder monthly
   - Review Failed folder weekly
   - Update job criteria quarterly
