# Critical Workflow Fixes Needed

## Issue 1: No Email Notifications
Currently, the email nodes exist but aren't connected:
- ❌ High Score Email - Not connected
- ❌ Standard Email - Not connected  
- ❌ Error Alert Email - Not connected

### Fix Required:
1. Add "Score > 80?" IF node after "Check Processing Success" → True output
2. Connect Score Check → True → Email High Score → Move to Processed
3. Connect Score Check → False → Email Standard → Move to Processed
4. Connect "Check Processing Success" → False → Email Error Alert → Move to Failed

## Issue 2: Infinite Loop for Failed Files

### Current Problem:
```
Failed CV → Move to Failed → Loop back to Split In Batches → Process again → Fail again → Infinite loop
```

### Solution Options:

#### Option A: Remove Loop from Failed Path (Recommended)
- Keep loop from "Move to Processed" → "Split In Batches"
- Remove connection from "Move to Failed" → "Split In Batches"
- Failed files stay in Failed folder, no reprocessing

#### Option B: Add Failure Tracking
- Add a "Set" node to mark files as "attempted"
- Add IF node to skip previously attempted files
- More complex but allows retry logic

#### Option C: Move Failed to Different Workflow
- Failed files trigger a separate "Manual Review" workflow
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Recommended Implementation:

1. **Disconnect the failed loop**:
   - Remove: "Move to Failed" → "Split In Batches" connection
   - This prevents infinite processing of corrupted files

2. **Add email notifications**:
   - Success path: Check score → Send appropriate email → Move to Processed → Loop
   - Failure path: Send error email → Move to Failed → END (no loop)

3. **Benefits**:
   - Failed files are logged, emailed, and stored for manual review
   - No infinite loops
   - Clear audit trail
   - Human intervention for edge cases

## Email Configuration Still Needed:
Remember to add Gmail OAuth2 credentials before the email nodes will work!
