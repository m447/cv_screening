# Simple Research Examples for CV Agent

## Quick Start - No API Setup Required

If setting up Google Search API is too complex, here are simpler alternatives:

### Option 1: Manual Research Trigger
Instead of automated search, the agent can:
- Generate search queries for you to run manually
- Create research checklists
- Format findings you paste back

**Example:**
```
You: "Research John Doe"
Agent: "Here are searches to run:
1. LinkedIn: 'John Doe software developer San Francisco'
2. GitHub: 'John Doe Python Django'
3. Google: 'John Doe XYZ Company engineer'

Please paste what you find and I'll compile a report."
```

### Option 2: Direct URL Analysis
If you already have candidate URLs:
```
You: "Analyze this LinkedIn profile: [URL]"
Agent: *Extracts and summarizes key information*
```

### Option 3: Bulk Search Queries
```
You: "Generate LinkedIn searches for all candidates > 80"
Agent: "Copy these into LinkedIn search:
1. 'Sarah Johnson data analyst NYC'
2. 'Mike Chen Python developer'
3. 'Emily Wilson machine learning SF'"
```

## Integration with Main Workflow

### Automated High-Score Research
Add to your main CV workflow after "Log to Sheets":

```
IF Score > 85
  ↓
Add to Research Queue
  ↓
Notify Agent: "New high-scorer: {name}, {email}, {score}"
```

### Weekly Research Batch
Schedule agent to run weekly:
```
"Research all candidates from this week with score > 80"
```

### Pre-Interview Research
Before interviews:
```
"Deep research on candidates scheduled for interviews"
```

## Practical Use Cases

### 1. Quick Verification
"Is John Doe really a senior developer at Google?"
- Agent searches for public verification
- Checks LinkedIn, company directories
- Reports findings

### 2. Skill Validation
"Find evidence of Python expertise for Sarah Johnson"
- Searches GitHub for Python projects
- Looks for Python mentions in profiles
- Checks for Python certifications

### 3. Red Flag Detection
"Any concerns about candidate Mike Chen?"
- Searches for professional issues
- Checks multiple name variations
- Reports only public, professional information

### 4. Culture Fit Research
"Find community involvement for Emily Wilson"
- Searches for conference talks
- Looks for open source contributions
- Checks for blog posts or articles

## Privacy-Conscious Approach

The agent is configured to:
- Only search professional information
- Skip personal social media
- Focus on work-related content
- Respect candidate privacy

## Simple Implementation Path

1. **Phase 1**: Query agent for CV database
2. **Phase 2**: Add manual research workflows  
3. **Phase 3**: Semi-automated with search suggestions
4. **Phase 4**: Full automation with APIs (when ready)

This gradual approach keeps things simple while adding value immediately.
