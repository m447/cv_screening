# CV Screening Workflow - Phase 1 Improvements

## Summary of Improvements Added

### 1. **Batch Processing**
- Added "Get All New CVs" node to list all PDFs in the folder
- Added "Split In Batches" node to process 5 CVs at a time
- Files loop back after processing for continuous batch handling

### 2. **File Movement**
- Added "Check Processing Success" node to route based on AI analysis result
- Added "Move to Processed" node - moves successful CVs to Processed folder
- Added "Move to Failed" node - moves failed CVs to Failed folder for manual review

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Updated "Call OpenAI API" to continue on fail
- Updated "Parse AI Response" to handle errors gracefully
- Added metadata fields (_processingSuccess, _fileId, _fileName, _error) for routing

## Next Steps to Complete Phase 1

### Email Notifications (Still Needed)
Since Gmail credentials need to be configured in n8n UI, you'll need to:

1. Add Gmail nodes manually in n8n:
   - After "Check Processing Success", add an IF node for Score > 80
   - Add "Email - High Score" Gmail node for scores > 80
   - Add "Email - Standard" Gmail node for scores <= 80
   - Add "Email - Error Alert" Gmail node for failed processing

2. Configure Gmail OAuth2:
   - Go to Credentials in n8n
   - Add Gmail OAuth2 credentials
   - Authorize access to send emails

### Updated Workflow Flow

```

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Deactivate the old workflow
   - Activate this enhanced workflow
   - Place 5-10 test CVs in the monitored folder
   - Monitor execution to ensure batch processing works

2. **Add Email Notifications**:
   - Add Gmail credential in n8n
   - Add email nodes as described above
   - Connect them after the success check

3. **Configure Folder Permissions**:
   - Ensure n8n has write permissions to both folders:
     - Processed: 1CQWsocqKluQnSkUdMGQsL-Owsr7aQXQn
     - Failed: 1mu9rgElrKMU1vt22EC7KaKWquw1EkJDP
