## Use Cases and Case Studies

Several companies have successfully improved their CV screening processes by implementing AI-powered tools and strategic changes. These improvements have led to reduced screening time, decreased bias, and better-quality candidates.

### Unilever

- **Challenge:** A massive number of applicants for entry-level roles made manual screening time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Solution:** Unilever implemented AI-powered platforms like HireVue. Their process combines AI analysis of video interviews and online games to assess candidates' emotional intelligence, creativity, and behavioral cues. This provides a more holistic view of each applicant.
- **Results:** Unilever reported a 50% reduction in the time spent screening candidates. This new process has significantly improved the experience for both recruiters and applicants.

### Hilton

- **Challenge:** A constant need to fill a large number of positions put a strain on their recruitment team.
- **Solution:** Hilton implemented AI to automate the initial recruitment stages. This includes using chatbots to interact with candidates, answer frequently asked questions, and pre-qualify applicants based on specific criteria.
- **Results:** The AI solution reduced the workload on recruiters and improved the candidate experience by offering a faster and more streamlined application process.

### Amazon

- **Challenge:** As a rapidly growing company, Amazon deals with an enormous volume of applications.
- **Solution:** While a well-known earlier attempt at an AI screening tool showed bias, Amazon has since moved towards using AI recruitment tools to streamline its process.
- **Results:** By implementing AI, Amazon aims to make the hiring process more efficient and fair.

### General Improvements with AI-Powered Screening

- A global technology firm that used the AI tool "Ideal" reduced its time-to-hire by 35% and improved quality-of-hire metrics by 20%.
- AI-powered tools like CVViZ can read resumes at a much faster rate than human recruiters, with high precision.
- AI solutions can lead to a more diverse and qualified talent pool by reducing unconscious bias in the initial screening stages. One report indicated a 40% increase in the quality and diversity of the talent pool after implementing an AI screening solution.

**Note:** While AI can significantly improve the screening process, it's crucial to monitor these systems for biases to ensure fairness. For instance, an early AI model at Amazon was found to be biased against female candidates because it was trained on predominantly male resumes.
